Misc problems : 

- bad native configuration for the airbus installed Docker Desktop
  - only one CPU available !!
  - low config of memory 



- networking : 
  - airbus network block some access, 
    - perhaps with a guest access it would be less intrusive.
  workaround : use your phone and hotspot for wifi
    -> a lot of data are downloaded in kibana to setup configuration : we need the network
    for instance : http://localhost:5601/app/home#/tutorial/apm
